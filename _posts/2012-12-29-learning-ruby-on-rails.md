A few weeks ago I decided to start the journey into using Ruby and more specifically the Rails framework. I have been working my way through the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book</a> over the past couple weeks and it's been very enlightening. 

Ruby has been a lot of fun to learn and I'm beginning to make the connections in how the Rails framework operates. I'm looking forward to starting my first real Rails app project when I finish the tutorial book.
