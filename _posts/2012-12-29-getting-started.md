This is my first blog post. About 6 months ago I started becoming interested in programming again. After reading a post on Reddit about a new free online university called Udacity I decided to check it out. From the first course lesson I was hooked. I hadn't done any actual programming in probably 6-7 years so I started with the CS101 course in Python. After a few short weeks it was a great feeling having learned a new language and realizing I had that spark again for programming. 

<h3>Web Development</h3>

After the intro course on Python I started the course that really had me intrigued, Web Applications Programming. I had a little knowledge of HTML and CSS going in, but that was about it. This course really taught me a lot about developing a server-side web application and all the different bits and pieces that go along with it. From HTTP request headers, deploying to a cloud hosting service like Google App Engine, and using GIT, to interacting with a database and generating HTTP from a template. This was a lot to take in for a noob like me but I kept plugging away and Googling for answers when I got stuck on something. 


<h3>What's this blog for?</h3>

After years of toiling away in tech-support jobs I finally recognized developing web applications is what I've always wanted to do with my life. 

It's time to start. This blog is where I will share updates on any new projects I'm working on and any web tools/technologies/languagaes I'm trying to learn.
